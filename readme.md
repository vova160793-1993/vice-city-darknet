# Vice City Market
Vice City is a biggest darknet market that opened in May 2020 and has managed to attract a dedicated crowd of customers and vendors. The market opened under the premise that it would pay special attention to customer service to differentiate itself from other markets that were seen as more unfair to buyers at the time.

### Registration / Login process:

The process of logging in to Vice City will almost always include solving a unique-looking captcha as the site is the frequent target of DDOS attacks. After you complete the captcha, you will be presented with the main login screen: Click on the “Register” link toward the bottom right to get started. As you can see from the account registration screen, you’ll only need to create a user name, password and PIN in order to start browsing the market.
Be sure to choose a user name that can’t be associated with your real life or other online identities, and a password that is a combination of at least 8 random characters. Also be sure to save this information somewhere secure but where you will remember where it is (never online or on a cloud-based server). After you have done this, press “Register” to continue.
You will now be transported back to the original homepage; this time with a green banner that reads “Registration Successful”. Re-enter your user name, solve the captcha, then press “Continue”. You then have to re-enter your user name, this time along with the password, to finally login. The front page of Vice City looks like this:
